# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game that runs in the browser
This is another JS project that I'm tackling to help improve my skills as a programmer, and 
specifically to refine my knowledge of JS. I'm trying my best not to rush to the topics
that interest me the most, and to properly take my time and process each aspect of the 
language, since I know most of them will be relevant later down the line when I start 
learning React frontend and node backend. I hope my patience will do me well and set 
me up for the future. Let's start!
