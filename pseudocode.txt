Pseudocode/general plan for Tic-Tac-Toe

Things that are needed:

-Function to create a gameboard using an array
-Function to create player
-Function to create the Game in general, probably consisting of multiple rounds.

Gameboard needs to:
-set up the board, initializing it to all empty (using the character '-'),
 though I guess using an enum would have been better.
-print it to the console

The Game Object needs to:
-get the gameboard
-get the two players
-run a certain amout of rounds
-decide and output the winner of the Game in general

The round object needs:
-to get and clear the gameboard
-accept the two players as arguments
-set up a loop that prompts the active player to enter their move over and over until the game is over
-make appropriate changes to the board after each move is made
-checks if the game is won/drawn
-adjust the players' scores accordingly
