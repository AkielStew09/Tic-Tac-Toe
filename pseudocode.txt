Pseudocode/general plan for Tic-Tac-Toe

Things that are needed:

-Function to create a gameboard using an array
-Function to create player
-Function to create the Game in general, probably consisting of multiple rounds.

Gameboard needs to:
-set up the board, initializing it to all empty (using the character '-'),
 though I guess using an enum would have been better.
-print it to the console

The Game Object needs to:
-get the gameboard
-get the two players
-run a certain amout of rounds
-decide and output the winner of the Game in general

The round object needs to:
-accept the two players as arguments
-set the active player as player 1
-prepare and clear the gameboard
-set up a loop that:
----prompts the active player to enter their move
----puts the move on the board
----switches the active character
----checks if the game is won/drawn to continue loop
-prints result of round
-adjust the players' scores accordingly
